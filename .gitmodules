# This is the .gitmodules file for the startup101.io repository. It contains the submodules that are used in the project.
# The submodules are your apps, and they are stored in separate git repositories. This file tells git where to find them.
# All of your submodules should look like this example:
# [submodule "apps/appname.com"]
# 	path = apps/appname.com
# 	url = git@github.com:username/appname.com.git
